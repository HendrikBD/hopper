Hopper
=======

Hopper is an RSS feed reader used to aggregate various sources of information from throughout the web. Hopper is developed as a web app and uses nodeJS as a backend. 

Hopper is designed as a Progressive Web App, as defined by Google. This is an app that loads quickly, caches itself, can be downloaded as an app and works for every screen size. This entails loading the app shell first, and using JavaScript AJAX functions to load the RSS feed.


Future Improvements
==================

This is intended as a personal project to provide a RSS reader that I could use, as well as a means to improve my development skills. In it's current state, it serves all the basic requirements, but I intend to fix any issues that I find.
